For some reason in linux when you press the number keys,
OpenGL doesn't recognize them (at least for me). So I made a simple fix for this bug.

I added fix for Czech and English layout, 
but you can modify it by your needs (in method me.joojn.util.KeyboardReflector.getFixedKey).

You can look at this [video](https://youtu.be/p1Tuc6zKm1I) how to add it to minecraft.

If you have any issues, you can contact me on discord `joojn#5485`.
